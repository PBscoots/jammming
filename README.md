Features

Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library (find Spotify endpoints here).
Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user's query.
Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.
Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.
Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.
Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
